** Why learn angular over other frameworks like Ember, Backbone, Knockout, etc?
   * Because many companies are hiring for it, and/or have legacy software written in it.  And it's slightly more complicated and less performant than many other frameworks.  It's like running with a small parachute or a weightvest.

** People have some very strong opinions about Angular. What are 3 common complaints people have about Angular?
   * It's slow on mobile.
   * It's complicated.
   * it has a constant page-update lock that means every piece of the page is constantly being checked for needing to be updated
   * there are many frameworks that either perform better, or facilitate faster development speed
    
** Is Angular an MVC framework?
   * yes, a #client side# model-view-controller framework, or Model-View-Modelview framework.

** Turn to the Angular docs. Find ng-app. What is it and what does it do? What does ng stand for?
   * apprently NG stands for Core Module.  (WTF?)  according to the docs, ng-app is for auto-bootstrapping an application, and it designates the root element of a document.
