feedback:

Too much lecture, 20-30 hours of 40-60hrs a week is too much lecture.

it's choking out my ability to complete projects (and on time as well)

being overmanaged ?

failure to release responsibility

lectures are not as valuable as having instructors available to help students with problems.

mid-afternoon is one of the worst times of day for us to work on our own.  I'd rather work on my own in the morning and have lectures in the afternoon, eavening.

But not both, and definitely not so much lecture.
